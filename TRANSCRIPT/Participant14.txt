00:00
So hello, how about you?

00:05
I am good, how are you? I am also good. So as we talked previously that me and my two colleagues, we are conducting a research that exploiting AI strategy in healthcare, particularly in terms of the data ethics and data privacy. So I will in the next 20 minutes, I will ask you 10 to 12 questions and you will give your

00:35
how you will like to interpret the AI in healthcare, your answer and my question. So entire conversation will be recorded. And we are.

00:46
conducting a research on behalf of Frankfurt University and under the guidance of Professor Valentin Schwinn. So your record will be accessed only by our three team members and if and only if they need it, then Professor Valentin Schwinn. So other than that, your privacy and your data will be protected with us. So if that is OK for you, then shall we begin? Yeah.

01:13
Yeah, so first of all, can you describe yourself a little bit that where you study and what you work? So we'll get an idea.

01:23
Yeah, I am currently studying my master's in the computer science at the University of Dumpster and currently working under the professor regarding the data analytics. Okay, perfect. So have you ever encountered with data set with a healthcare or have you ever worked with it?

01:47
Yeah, I have worked on one project which taking the data from the, using the Apple watch of the person and then we are training the model on that data. So after that we get the accuracy and other things.

02:17
ongoing ongoing ongoing ok yeah so you are currently working so how do you how do you perceive the impact of AI on diagnosis accuracy in in in field so how much accuracy is important in artificial intelligence in healthcare

02:39
As per my experience, the accuracy is more important, a more important thing while we are considering the health sector because we are diagnosis the disease which might be, which might, if the results are not, accuracy is not good, then it might be, it might be cause a very harmful effect on the patient's health.

03:09
So I think the accuracy is very much far better than, far more important features when we training model. Okay, yeah. So for getting accuracy, how important do you think the quality of the data, quality of the training data set is for the effectiveness of AI system in healthcare?

03:38
Yeah, as I said earlier that data is the key factor when we are dealing with the health sector. So the data must be accurate. That data must be accurate. That is the policy when we are dealing with the analytics or training the machine learning model. So and the data will be

04:08
about our purpose or the goal of the class. So I think there's two things are considered when we are dealing with the AI. Correct, correct. So.

04:25
So can you provide some example that how training data quality affect or you have an encounter with that if your data quality is not bad and you get bad result you have an example like that?

04:39
Yes, I have said before that I am currently working on one project in which we are taking the measurements of the health, regarding health like oxygen level and blood pressure and the sugar level, which by which we can find the healthiness of the person.

05:09
I can say that we can consider as the key factor as per my knowledge and my topic.

05:25
So, if we don't have a really good data or like some person have missing value then we cannot get accurate result according to you. Yeah.

05:39
So I explained like that. Now we jump in the person's privacy and data that how AI will AI take all the data of the person. But then after all the data all over on the internet, so person's data will not save sometimes. So what access control measures are currently in place? So you have any access control measure?

06:09
your data your person's data like the data that you will get is perfectly safety with you only other person cannot access

06:21
Yeah, currently we are proposing the password. If we generate any AI model, then we are generating the password for each individual users from which we are getting the data. And all the passwords and the details are going to be encrypted so that the authorization can be

06:51
access with legal person. Okay so yeah so how confident are you you you propose the idea that you you use key and password and will encryption so every encryption will be a decryption so what do you think that your this idea will work or you have to think more

07:19
Yeah, I think that this is not sufficient for the privacy. But it might be it's like a one layer protection. But we can use protocols which might be useful. And we and other firewalls. OK.

07:49
fire walls which may might be useful. So basically I have an idea like that if we can if we hired a third party's company or we can give the safety entirely safety to them then they implement the safety so is this in your opinion good option or not so as a AI engineer we only have expertise in developing AI model and everything will not conclude more about safety so third party will

08:19
is a very good idea or not? I think that third party is not a good idea but there there are government agencies which might be can be useful for these kind of things. Okay.

08:38
because government authorities is using the securities. So. Yeah, good. So from your perspective, what ethical consideration are most critical when using AI in healthcare? What kind of the tech care we have to take while we working on AI model in terms of the privacy and ethics? Yeah, when we are talking about the privacy

09:08
First of all, we have to be transparent about the data which we are taking from the users and we have to tell our models, agents, policy and other things. And as like a...

09:32
health policy we can say that in which we are described in the agent described the policy to the to the policy taker. So I think that will be the great idea.

09:49
So how do you think that AI will impact in patient's care or in treatment planning that if our AI system will tell something and you should follow or you will not follow for example you have cold and you ask AI that how could I preserve the cold and AI will suggest something so you will follow or not.

10:12
As per my decision, I would definitely take the suggestion from the MI AI, but not follow all the suggestions that is provided by the AI. I prefer more going...

10:32
more about the prescription given by the doctor. Yeah, correct. So this is the concern. My next question is the same, that people don't have entirely trust on AI. So for example, what should we do in AI driven healthcare so people can trust on us?

10:55
Yeah, so for that first of all we have to give the awareness about the AI in the health care sector and how the model is working and give the live demo among the people so that they can get the trust on the model. Okay. So.

11:24
So what do you think that after a few years, AI can make a place in healthcare or people are still relying on taking a doctor's appointment and getting concerned for doctor for every little thing?

11:42
I think the combination of the specialist and the AI will be good because sometime it might be possibility that AI will not get the idea when the new disease occur like corona, the symptoms are not identified the AI. So I think that.

12:09
sometimes it is better to take the advice of the AI. And yeah, correct. So yeah, that leads us to the end of the interview. You gave such a wonderful information. And at the end, you would like to share something else that you think that might be useful and research. So you can feel free to share.

12:34
Yeah, for the training and for training the data, the data will be accurate. That is the must to be done as per we are working on the health sector. And regarding privacy, I think we have to be transparent and first of all take the concern about the data which we are taking because it is private.

13:04
it because when it was leaked sometime it might be dangerous for the users. Yeah, correct. So yeah, yeah, that's a wonderful conversation and I would like to thank you again that you give us time and agreed to be interviewing for from your project and also I would like to mention again your data will be safe with us, will not be breached

13:34
tempered also so yeah thank you for participating and have a good day bye bye thank you bye
