00:00
So, hello, how are you? I am fine, what about you?

00:07
I am also good. So as we discussed before our research is going on the how AI impact on the patient's privacy and ethics and also how we can improve improve or how we can derive the strategy to prevent exploiting AI in healthcare. So as I said earlier that your video and your audio will

00:37
purpose me and my two teammates so we are group of three and some of your video or transcript may be examined by our professor Valentin Schweitzer. So other than that your privacy is on as considered as your privacy your data will not be breached and will safe with us. So shall we begin with that? Okay.

00:59
So can you please describe yourself, that where you study or what kind of role you will play in organization or are you doing some projects or what? Yes, I am Divya Sadanani and currently I am pursuing my master degree in Informatics at Westbrook University.

01:28
Okay, correct. So what do you think that how do you preserve the impact of artificial intelligence in diagnosis accuracy in your field?

01:42
If we saw in every artificial intelligence system, the accuracy is the main part, because based on accuracy, we can get a better result and we can make better decision. And this is why we must focus on the accuracy of the model. Yeah, correct. So for you, how important do you think that the quality of the training data is for the effectiveness of AI system in healthcare?

02:12
quality of data will affect the output of the AI system in healthcare? Yes, quality of data is important for our artificial intelligence system or model because if we don't have the good quality data then we will not get the better result and the output and that is why we have the detailed training data and in various aspects also that is why we can get the better

02:42
model prediction about our problem.

02:48
Can you provide some of example that have you did sometimes that they have quality of data will affect the AI model performance? So have you ever been go through or you or your friends or you know some such incident like that so? Yeah, I know that in past I did one project and in this project we took the

03:14
variety of the data to train over the model because the

03:19
variety of the data is good to have. And also we have a detailed training data. That is why our model performs better in way. And that is why we generally more focus on how we can collect the data related to our problem. Correct, yeah. So basically what happened in healthcare as we discussed that we more focus on the patient's ethics and privacy.

03:49
access system. So we give patients through the limited access to the application if the doctor is superior so they can access the whole application data. If you are working with a nurse level or something like that moderate level so you can you can you can access the one patient's particular data and to the limited to the one disease. We cannot see the whole patient's previous data so we can derive like this. We can give the

04:19
different people so so have you ever used like this access control to protect the patients detail yeah first of all the security is the priority for the users and that is why we must use any kind of the access control like we can put the password so that we can we encrypt the data and also

04:48
So we must focus on that authentic person can get the

04:54
data and that is why we also day by day improve over the security. So you you believe in the access control system so only authentic like a proper doctor person can access the whole the data set and not other person can access whole data set so like that yeah yes so so do you think that if we if we

05:24
their lives so it will helps to improve patients privacy do you think that okay if we do like this that give more access to the doctor less access to the nurses and very less to the other person so it will help or not as per opinion yes it will of course help because if we give the like password technique or encrypts to data then it is also trustable for our users and that is

05:54
users believes in the artificial intelligence model otherwise they don't believe to use the artificial intelligence model. So from your perspective that what kind of ethical consideration that are must be we use while developing healthcare for example sometime we use that I give you earlier example that we can give a access based control or otherwise we can derive one privacy policy

06:24
we can educate the people that how this works. So what do you think that what kind of ethical consideration that most critical when we using AI in healthcare? Yes, I said previously that data privacy is most important for the user and this is why we must use the AI for our fairness and that is why our artificial intelligence

06:54
The system must be transparent and how the artificial intelligence works. It is also known by the doctors, nurses and also by the teachers. That is why it is a trust in the artificial intelligence model.

07:10
So how do you think that AI has impact patients care in treatment planning and process in your experience? For example, if I have something like if I have cold and I ask AI, so AI will give the instruction that what should do and what should not do. So it will be helpful as a patient or do you think AI will not give a correct answer?

07:36
No, I don't think so because AI gives you the treatment planning faster and also accurate is provided by the doctor and that is why it also reduces the chances of human error rate. Yeah, basically it will be helpful. As we lived in Germany, we cannot get a doctor's appointment. So it will be a first stage. So people can follow the AI step until they get the doctor appointment.

08:06
So, yeah, yeah, yeah, we can do this like this. So have you noticed that any change in patients trust? So for example, we I know and you also know that how AI works. So we can trust on AI. So some other people's don't know about the AI. So they don't trust. So how this will affect towards future in AI?

08:29
As you said that trust is the more important to use the artificial intelligence system and that is why...

08:39
we must become our system transparent. And also nowadays, more people are comforting with artificial intelligence system because when they use the artificial intelligence system, they will get the benefits from the artificial intelligence system. And that is why day by day they are improve the...

09:08
So we can educate the people to trust us. So what improvements or enhancements would you like to see in AI technology that can support healthcare? For example, as we consider two major issues that we have patients privacy and data governance and have a treatment in accuracy.

09:38
to improve this thing in future?

09:44
make the technology then we also assess by the doctors and it's also generally depends on the data we can use to train our model because in every different different diseases we have to train our model into different different kind of data so basically it also depends on the data we have which type of data we generally use to train our model and

10:14
our model can work but at the end we also assist our model by the doctors means human. Okay. So how do you visualize the future of AI in future years that it is things will also useful or like we are living illusion? We are not living illusion because if I think about

10:43
Next three to five years, then it's gives impact on the human because people generally open the application or something like that and just upload the photos and they will get what kind of the disease they have and what kind of the pre-possession or pre-exception they will get by the application. And this is good.

11:13
the artificial intelligence and so work so faster. So yeah, so yeah, that's we that's lead to this end of this interview and so if you have any such things that you would like to share and you you like that it will help full us in our research then you can share it now if you have such things then.

11:39
Generally, I don't have any kind of work, but I can say that if we get any kind of result from the artificial intelligence, then also we have to assist by the doctor because at the end the artificial intelligence is one kind of robots like that.

12:09
AI advice or like some major disease we can have to check by the doctor you want to say like this or for all of that we have to check? No, no for all of that if I say all of that then we don't need any kind of the activation. Yeah correct that's why I am considering. It is not the situation of the diseases. Yeah yeah correct so yeah thank you thank you for your time and sharing your knowledge with us

12:39
and will help full to conclude at our final decision. So I would like to mention again your data, your video and your audio will be protected, will not use by any other ways or will not tampered at any cost. So yeah, thank you and have a nice day. Thank you too.
