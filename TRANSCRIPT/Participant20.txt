00:00
But I'm planning to do so. Okay. So, I'm telling you some little story that for example, we have, I built some kind of app and I, for healthcare related app that are predicting or if customer ask them, okay, I have had XO, what should I do? And the AI assistant will give the answer like that. So in this, what do you think? How important?

00:30
the quality of training data to build an effective AI healthcare system. So what is important of training data set in that?

00:41
Yeah, absolutely. Tending data shouldn't be biased.

00:47
as if we are going to use the model for some kind of some segment of person or some segment of object then the training data should be confirmed that segment only. Yeah. Otherwise our data will be biased. Correct.

01:13
dog.

01:18
I got a call from somewhere else, I will edit that.

01:27
So you have anything in your mind or have you encountered like something where the AI healthcare or some app are predictive or wrong data? Like if you ask something or they give you answer like something else, this thing before happened with you or?

01:48
I don't rely on AI for my medical answers, like medical consultation. I don't think that current AI models are that much reliable or AI applications are that much reliable, where I can have my medical consultation.

02:18
right? So we give our data to the we have one app ROG S2. So we are giving our data to the app and they are predicting and then after after some time nowhere else our data got breached. So our data are details all over the internet platform. So what as a probably we think that if we build some kind of app or something like that. So

02:45
We can like divide the access if you are using this app as a patient then you are not allowed to run some features. If you are using as a medicist or something like a moderator then you have some kind of other access and if you are superior doctor then you have some kind of other access. So what do you think this kind of access control will help

03:14
to protect the data or not? No, I don't think so that this kind of protection will protect our data because it's a normal though this way is a kind of standard procedure we are following right now and what we did in our Aragisetwa app as well and we go and data code did in that app.

03:44
So instead of using this normal or standard procedure, we should, we might use a blockchain security system to secure the user data. Yeah. As it is a private and public case, so yes, we can differentiate who can and who cannot see the data.

04:14
That's exactly my next question that then what you will suggest then you already answered that's good. So You asked about the blockchain method to you So how confident you are that is this going to be for or not? So it's not a pressure that if you say it then it should be absolutely work. I just asked your opinion that Yeah, no problem It's the block chain security is not 100%

04:44
sure it has also vulnerabilities like if you go into detail it would be much more technical but on surface level each and every security security system is its own drawbacks sorry own drawbacks and blockchain is not 100% sure about breaking the blockchain blockchain

05:12
technology or a blockchain security system has some kind of difficulty. That means attacker might attack or the what can I say

05:32
vulnerabilities in the security system will be less mm-hmm at what I think yeah so yeah technology has some disadvantage as always so we can we can overcome of that by using only good set of blockchain for example will not dip dive in so much only use some basic stuff to

05:56
to create a layer in between patients or some moderator apps or some superior doctors. So we can do that like that. Yes, yes, absolutely.

06:13
So, can you give me a minute? I have some calls and...

06:19
Yeah, sure.

06:30
Yeah. So this is a nice answer that you dive into a different technology that we can combine with artificial intelligence and build a secure system. So from your perspective, what is more important, like a patient's ethical consideration or patient's interaction with the doctors and other things? So if someone...

06:59
For example, I'm a patient and I'm worried about my privacy. So if some healthcare or some AI tool ask about my information. So should I put false information? So I so it's more important for me about my privacy or about my health situation. So if I put a correct data, then I'll get a right output. So what do you think?

07:24
Yeah.

07:27
It's a debatable question. Debatable topic actually you asked. What I think is that If if if you give me a Information some kind of information and I put label in it that it is this information is provided by vishwa

07:48
then it will be a security issue for you, security concern for you but if I put it on a level like provided by XYZ yeah not knowing that, not having a relation between XYZ and Vishwa NEM

08:05
then it would be better then for patient if we secure data with some kind of ID instead of encrypted ID I am not talking about encrypted ID because it's just a normal ID a number then we can solve that issue

08:28
We will not break the privacy of patient and we will be able to provide him or her kind of service that we want to. Correct. Yeah, that we can also do. So as per your opinion, we can do like that if I can give my data anonymous and will link with another ID like as a normal. So they'll don't know never know about this data is mine.

08:58
Yes. So that we have to there are some privacy concern and like everything if I'm using for log information like for my ID so in dark web they will know about my ID so we have to think about this also but never mind that sometimes what happened that IBM has the IBM Watson Studio for as a AI Healthcare tool.

09:25
So if I ask this that, okay, I have a flu or I have a cold. So what should a treatment planning process? So they give us like some pro something that we have to follow that, okay. Not eating some cold thing or anything. So what do you think as a AI can be helpful for a treatment planning process like initial treatment planning process that help.

09:53
us to help patients to get better till he or she will reach the doctor. So for kind of the first aid.

10:07
Yes, it can be helpful. And it cannot be it's I think it has a it has a paradox kind of thing. Yeah. So yeah, that's that's if I'm asking any question it has a paradox. So you have to give your opinion if you ask something about AI and they will tell you okay, you should you should take a hot milk. So will you take or not or you will like

10:37
you will confirm with other people and then take what will you do.

10:45
Would you repeat the whole phase? Yeah, yeah. So, yeah, if you have, if you get cold and if you ask AI, AI assistant, what should I do as a precaution? And if they say you have to drink a hot water or hot tea, so you will drink it, you will follow the instruction or you will confirm with other person and then drink it. What should you do in this situation?

11:14
Yes, okay. So if my pain is... Can I say... So much stuff, yeah. If I am not able to handle the pain of my body, then I will definitely follow the instructions, basic information, which I think that they won't harm my body that much. Even if I do it wrong.

11:41
and simultaneously I will concern with others maybe doctor so you are telling about you follow your instinct right? so if you get instinct that okay drinking in hot water or hot tea or hot milk there is no harm in my body ultimately so you think like that no no no not particularly Vishwa I won't follow my instinct because I will go through all

12:09
In a logical way I mean. Yeah, yeah. That yes, drinking hot water won't harm my body that much. It's a very logical way. Yeah, correct. But if I have options where I'm not sure about what would be better, then I will go by my instinct. Correct, correct. So what do you suggest? In future, there is something or maybe more than something.

12:37
from the AI will including healthcare for sure. So what do you see a future like, okay, if I'm using some healthcare tool or some healthcare app, for example, like fitness training app or something like that. So what do you expect from the healthcare in perspective of the patient's privacy and the accuracy of the outcome of the healthcare? So what do you expect from the future?

13:08
I would expect that my yes definitely the company organization who is going to build the application or services they will definitely going to use my information or data to make better services next make better services but I will prefer to

13:36
provide me some insurance about assurance that the data doesn't get leaked outside. And you think that you think like that if they are protecting data 100% sure but sometime you know some people are vulnerable or something or something happen in technical technical thing or might your data get breached so you will concern like okay I have to go and complain the.

14:04
data governance. So you you have care about your data or okay, like nothing major will be happen. I'll do nothing. What kind of person you are.

14:16
is also a very depending situation. Yeah. So for example, some people will not care about that like and some people are so so care about their personal information. So they will be angry for sure. So yeah, what would you think? Yes, okay. Until and unless.

14:43
I am not seeing some very harmful effects from my personal data leakage. I won't care that much about it. But if it involves the other side, then I will definitely look into it and go further.

15:13
you have some disease and you overcome this disease by using an AI tool or something like that and you get a data breach. So you are okay with that or not or for example AI didn't help you to overcome that or you are not perfectly well using AI app and then you got data breached. So this action like you getting well or getting not well will affect to the data breached or not.

15:46
No, I don't think so that it will affect. Yeah, for example, some people are like, okay, they giving me nothing and they taking my data. For example, the mindset. Yes, definitely. That's the scenario nowadays. Yeah. So, for now, they didn't concerned about previously, but they didn't get anything, so they will be concerned. So that's another story.

16:13
So yeah, you go through pretty well. So I conclude your interview and go to the last question that what do you feel like? Okay, I'm a very friendly or very horrible or ask unnecessary questions. No, no, no, your questions were very reasonable and I'm happy to answer them. And yes, the answer to these questions are very important.

16:43
working in a pharmacology or medical extreme. Yeah, correct, correct. So you also believe that our patient's data and ethics is more important, correct. Yes, definitely. I think it's important. So yeah, thank you for your time. And as I said earlier, that this video recorded will only use for a study purpose, will never use again. And yeah, this if.

17:12
we are analyzing this video it will be me and I have two other team member we only three or might be our professor yeah nothing more than that so I also give you a sure that your privacy will be safe with us and yeah thank you yeah thank you for cooperative and your time and getting through us yeah thank you. Pleasure is mine.

17:39
Thank you,
