Hello, how are you? Hello, I am good. So...

00:06
As we talked before that I have two teammates so we three are conducting a research that how AI exploiting in a healthcare that related to the patient's privacy and ethical concern. So basically in next 20 minutes I will ask you a set of questions like contains 10 to 12 questions like around. You have to give your opinion that what you really believe and other than that this

00:36
between you and me will be recorded and this will be used for only research only by my two colleagues and sometimes the professor this research will undergo the under the guidance of professor valentine schwing so your data will be secure and your yeah your privacy will not be breached so is this okay with you then shall we begin

01:01
yeah yeah sure so yeah so first of all can you describe yourself like what are you doing currently or what you have done in terms of ai and you have some experience like that okay so basically i'm currently doing my masters in artificial intelligence from

01:22
University called as THWS. So and currently I'm in Germany since three months and yeah doing

01:35
related to AI in the past.

01:39
So yeah, that's what I'm doing right now. That's enough here. So sometimes what happened that as I'm trying to train machine learning models. So for example, I tried a machine learning model for a health care application. So sometimes it gives a right data or it gives a wrong data. So how accuracy is important in this term? So accuracy, how accuracy is important?

02:09
in healthcare application as per your opinion that machine learning application or AI application should be accurate or will be less accurate than its file. Okay, so I think accuracy is a more important part of the product because accuracy describe how

02:37
Okay, so accuracy is the most important part that you have to focus while building machine learning or any applications in general

02:48
Yeah, so that's what I'm doing. So, sometimes that accuracy depends on data also, that we fed a bad data or something like that, so we will not get accuracy truly. So, is it important that the quality of data in AI application in healthcare or not?

03:10
Yeah, so training data quality is crucial. Without accurate diverse and repeated data, A models can't perform reliably, which could lead to poor outcomes. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So do you have any example that how training data quality influence, or you know something about that and you want to share?

03:33
Yeah, so in one of our project our model initially struggled with accuracy because the training data led diversity By including more varied data, we were able to significantly improve its performance across different groups. Okay Yeah, so So that's that's for the training quality now now I my more question based on the patients privacy and ethics. So If some some healthcare application have access

04:03
So if you are patients, then they will not give you all the excess of the application So if you are superior doctor, then they have then they had all the excess of the application They can manage the all the excess of the application if you are a Middle like a nurses or anything so they will not give you all the excess like they give you a moderate excess For example same is as you work in a company So as an intern you have limited access as a manager you have more excess

04:33
So this kind of access based control are currently page currently are using in AI healthcare So is this a really useful as a organization that we should implement more or you have any other suggestion for privacy?

04:49
Okay, so I think role-based access control is more efficient. Multi-factor authentication and encryption to protect patient data, access is monitored and regularly audited to ensure complement with privacy standards. Okay. So yeah, these are useful nowadays in industry. So how confident are you that for you as per your opinion, this things will going to work or not or sometime it may fails or not?

05:19
Okay, so I think I'm quite sure and I'm very confident about my sentence. Our measures are strong, but with the evolving nature of cybersecurity threats, it's important to continuously update and monitor our systems. Yeah, correct. So as per from your perspective, what ethical consideration are major critical when using the AI in healthcare?

05:47
So avoiding bias in system and ensuring patient data privacy are the top ethical concerns. Transference in how AI is used in patient care is also essential to maintaining trust.

06:02
Okay, yeah, that's that's enough answer. So So what do you think like AI that that done so much AI in healthcare? So there is anything that make impact in patients patient statement planning process For example, if I am using AI tool and I have a cold then I write that I have a cold Please give me some suggestion. So they will give me some suggestion like okay You will drink a hot water or you will drink a tea or something like that

06:32
So patients are really following these things or they have concerns like, okay, AI might be wrong. So yeah. I think patients are very much accepting the fact that.

06:52
AI is more efficient and by enabling more personalized treatment plans and improving the efficiency of care delivery allowing clinicians to focus more on direct patient interaction is a very efficient idea in my opinion. Yeah, so have you ever noticed that any changes in patient's trust? Same I explained you previously that patients will not willingly to trust in AI model or as we people know that how AI works so we can trust but some

07:22
people from non-technical background will never trust. So what is your approach to, approach towards the AI-driven service? Certainly there is growing acceptance and trust in AI, particularly when patients see positive outcomes. However, there is still some agitation, especially around the privacy concerns. Yeah.

07:46
So what we can do to improve or enhance that people can use more AI healthcare with trust thing so what we can do like provide to patients trust. Okay in my opinion I think more interpretable AI models and better integration with the existing healthcare system would be a very good idea.

08:12
or we can give a training to the people also. So it is a good that we'll give a training, then they will learn about and slowly, slowly, they can try to trust AI model. So what do you think that in future that how AI will interpreted in healthcare? Like in nowadays will not totally depends on AI in healthcare. We are trying to be interpreted. So it could be a next big thing in five to 10 years

08:42
or what kind of future AI have in healthcare? Okay, so I think AI becoming more integrated into routine care, especially in predictive analytics and personalized medicine.

08:57
But on the other side, ongoing work is needed to address ethical concerns and ensure equitable access. Yeah, perfect. So yeah, this leads into the our semi-structured interview. So basically, yeah, thank you for giving us time or is there anything that you would like to share or you think that that might be useful in our research, then you will share. Okay.

09:25
Yeah, so successful AI in healthcare requires collaboration across disciplines and focus on improving patient outcomes. Yeah. Continuous learning and ethical consideration are key to harnessing AI's full potential, I think. Okay, yeah, that's pretty enough. So, thank you for your valuable time and thank you for giving us time and sharing your thought with us.

09:55
answer will help us to help us to do research in terms of that and I would like to again mention that this video will be recording and the audio will be used for analyzing purpose only your video and data will not be breached and video not be tampered in any such manner or will not shared in any social media or anything without your concern so thank you for joining with me and have a nice day

10:24
Okay, so...
