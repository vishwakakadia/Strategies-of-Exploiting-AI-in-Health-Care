Hello, how are you? I'm doing good. What about you? I'm also good. So basically we speak before that I am Vishwa and me with my two colleagues, we are going to conduct a research about high exploiting AI strategies in healthcare. Basically main focus on patient's privacy and ethical concern.

00:25
So in next couple of next 50 minutes, I will ask a bunch of questions that you have to give answer as your opinion or what you think like that. And also I would like to mention that the conversation between us will be recorded. So this video and audio will only use for analytical purpose and for research purpose only. Your video will not be tempered or not be misused in any of

00:55
is this okay for you then we can start yeah it's okay for you yeah so first of all can you describe your yourself about what things you do and like this yeah well i'm working as a data scientist in research team my main job is to develop and develop and include the AI models which realize more on doctor square

01:25
I would say predictions and I also work more closely with the doctor to meet realistic requirements. Okay. So, how do you perceive the impact of AI in diagnosis accuracy? AI has gradually improved the accuracy in diagnosis by providing the extra layer of

01:50
doesn't get tired or the miss of title details. It is especially useful in medical imaging and the predictions.

02:00
there consistency is a very crucial part. Still, I would say we can't rely on the AI. We can work AI and the doctor simultaneously. Okay. Yeah, correct. So what do you think that sometimes we give a data and we build AI model and then we realize, okay, this model is not accurate. They are going to, they provide a wrong answer. So what do you think the quality of

02:30
in AI healthcare system.

02:34
is really very crucial part while it's come to the healthcare. And if the data is not properly reliable, and I would say if it's a biased data and not properly representative of our use cases, then it would predict the wrong, and it can cost more.

02:53
when it comes to the patients. So I would say that that is really important. Yeah, correct. So you have dealt any of thing in while working with the AI model, like you complete all the model and you get a wrong output or you get a low score as a model accuracy. Has anything happened, this kind of thing happened with you? Yeah, I can remember the one.

03:22
recently incident, we had a patient with one disease. I can't really provide the detail, but I would say there was a patient with one disease. When we test using our AI model, AI model score was very low because of the bias data. When we trained our model, we couldn't have that data.

03:48
So, model was not pretty good. Yeah. After we retrained the model and yeah, we solved it. So, now I ask about some question about patients' privacy and all. So, nowadays it's very crucial for the privacy of patients that we can find all the patients' data over all online platform. So,

04:09
what most of people do that they invent access-based control. So for example, if I am a doctor then I can access whole the data. If someone is nurse or anything, so they can access only their department data, not whole database. And patients can access only their data. So this kind of access control system they are using to...

04:32
using to protect the data. So are you use this kind of system in your organization or you have other things for protection? Yeah in our organization I would say we have almost the same thing. We have also multi-layer security system means the one person can't access the entire data set. They have proper role so on that role one can access the limited data. If the doctor and he's a senior doctor and

05:00
they have access to all the data and accordingly as you said if anyone is a nurse or lower than a doctor category they can't access entire data set and also we have proper security team. So how confident you are these things work properly or sometime like 80-20% or what do you think?

05:26
I would say in my organization it is working properly. We have, as I said, we have a proper team. They make sure about the integrity of the data. And also they make sure about cyber attacks and that sort of stuff. So they continuously monitor all the things. So from your perspective, what ethical considerations are most critical when using AI in healthcare?

05:59
I would say the data privacy and data privacy is the most critical thing when it comes to the patient privacy and it is also crucial to be transparent with the patient about the AI means there sometimes it work like the black box so there should be proper transparency. Yeah correct. So how do you think that AI has impact the patients care in treatment planning process?

06:31
It has improved the patient care by offering more personalized treatment options based on individual data. It also helps health care providers make quicker and more accurate treatment plans. This has led to better outcomes for patients and more efficient care.

06:53
So have you noticed any changes in patients trust? Is that some people are trusting too much and some are not believing in AI. So have you noticed any changes? Yes, there has been increasing the patient trust. Before I would say that there wasn't trust, respect to ride out.

07:22
So trust has been increasing gradually. Okay. So what do you think what we can do to improve my trust in patients that they are good to go with using AI tools? We can take a number of steps. First, there should be proper transparency between the AI and the patient. Means if the AI tool, we have one tool.

07:48
So if it is telling something, there should be proper transparency. And there should be proper reason how the decision is coming out. Correct. So yeah, that's leaders end of the interview. Thank you for your knowledge and thank you for your time. I would like to mention again that your video was recorded and will not any will only use for analytical purpose and research purpose. So thank you.
