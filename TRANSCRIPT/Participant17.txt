How about you?

Yeah, so me I'm Vishwa and I'm student at Frankfurt
University of Applied Sciences me with my two

colleagues we are researching on how XAI can
exploiting in a healthcare and we're deriving

the strategy of that as we speak before this
is more basically concern about the ethical

concern and patients privacy and data so next
20 to 15 minutes. I will ask you 15 to 20 questions

and you have to you have to give answer that
what you think and what you believe um Your

data means the conversation between us will
be recorded And will only use for a research

purpose and a study purpose for analyzing uh
will your video will not be tempered or will

not modified or Not be on any internet. So Is
this okay for you? Then shall we begin? Yes,

I am okay. So can you tell about yourself? Myself,
Yash, Kathilia.

Okay. So what do you think that in more scenario
that we are giving the training data set to

the AI model? So sometime our model is over
fitting, sometime is under fitting. So basically

training data set is important for AI model
or not? Yes, training it seems like

It is one type of we can consider it as a solution
of biases or for the overfitting and underfitting

Yeah, because you said the large data is beneficial
but large data can be lead as overfitting So

my question is like that um Large amount of
data but accurate data So is this okay or do

you think the other way also?

if we have good data for our AI systems. So
it can,

More, we can get more output. So, yes.

So that's you talk about the quality of important
data. So we have to feed good quality data

to our model. So our model will perform well
and give accurate result. So can you have an

example like that you work in past or something
like that? You have a good or bad quality of

data and your result will be ruined or anything
happen with you in past? Yeah, in one of my

project.

skin cancer prediction project and in that project
we have.

It's a classic problem and one of the research
papers that published based on this problem

That also had the same problem. They published
a research paper and then they realized they

have this bias on that and yeah Is this kind
of problem happened in past also so correct?

Yeah, so So now we talk about the patient's
privacy and data like if I have application

or something like that. So for the protect the
data we can add the access base control. So

like if you are a superior doctor, then you
can access all the data. If you are a nurse,

then you access only some kind of data. And
if you are a patient, then you have no access

to data like that. So we can try this access-based
control system. So have you used this kind

of system in your organization for protecting
the data or you use something else for data

protection? Yes, yes, this approach was also
in our...

like only some authorized people can

manage that sensitive information and also we
have some two-step authentication and also

encryption for our data to keep secret. So how
confident are you that effective the excess

control based model this kind of model will
work for patients privacy or not?

I am confident with this security but as we
all know like

cybercrime are very ongoing and so we have to
must be updated and secure with protocols and

we have to take privacy we have to keep privacy
day on day by day yeah so you think this thing

access based private protocol thing will work
for and is that work for your organization

also right yeah right okay So from your perspective,
what kind of ethical considerations are most

critical when using AI in healthcare, particularly
we concern about patients interaction and privacy.

One of the transparency like patients should
know when AI is used in their care and how

the data will be.

So how do you think AI has impacted patient's
care or treatment planning in your experience?

AI can analyze like AI will predict the disease
by the basis of patient's previous history,

treatment or any other reports etc. And this
level of personalization was difficult before.

So, AI is great in the prediction of disease.
Correct. So, have you noticed any changes in

patient's trust when patients are using AI driven
healthcare? I am sure that you sometimes test

your AI tool on someone. So, they have any trust
issue or they are okay with using AI tool?

much better results. They have so much trust
on AI, but there are also the oldest people

and also the people who... less knowledge about
the technology have still some doubts and they

cannot trust truly. So you first mentioned that
some of the group of people have so much trust

on AI. So can you describe which kind of group
like they are so much educated or they are

scientists or something so which kind of group
you can demograph this group so I can get a

better idea. As you say the scientist and etc.
Like for example if I am the patient and I

started my consulting with AI. But in my first
time I will not trust 100% but after I will

get some results and if I feel like I am the
better then I will recommend to other also.

So that's how they... they gain the trust and
some of the group that you have in this AI

trust the trust issue is still in progress to
be handled so what do you think what can we

do to improve this issue how we made people
to trust on AI maybe We have to make familiar

more and more people.

we have to give the work flow of the air and.

educate the people about the technology.

So, how can we educate people about the technology?
For example, we know the technology, we know

how they work, but the patients all are not
from the technological background. Some of

are not as literate to understand the AI technology.
So how can we teach them?

have any other plans or you face this kind of
issue? Maybe the first is, is we discuss recommendation

technique is can be worked like we can recommend
person by person or also by the environment.

If we made a user friendly environment and easy
to use environment, the

So yeah, this leads towards the end of our interview,
but the last I want to ask you that is there

anything that you want to share with us that
can help in our research?

Yeah, like I have learned that successful AI
in healthcare relies to close collaboration

with AI experts and healthcare providers. Like
AI develop.

Same as vice versa, healthcare providers need
to understand. So both should have to work

together. And what kind of inclusion they can
do in terms of the privacy and ethical concern

about the patients?

That is...

like people the

by the doctor. So, if the developer have enough
data to...

to fade, fade model or something. To fade model
or yes, then that's enough for the developer.

And again, if any... I'm not talking here about
data only. I'm talking about a patient's privacy.

Sometimes we use data on health care or something
else, then patient's data got leaked. So it's

about a patient's privacy. So is there things
that the AI developer can take care about or

is not to worry about? No, no, the developer
should have to be worried about it. it we as

we already discussed many of the methods like
two step authenticators like patient can login

patient can make authentication after login
again. Okay thank you for your time. and yeah

as I see as I want to say again that yeah your
data and your video is safe with us will not

be tampered or will not be modified in future
so thank you for your valuable knowledge to

contribute our research bye
