Hello, how are you?

So as we speak before, myself, Vishwa, and I
have with two colleagues that we are going

to research about

how AI in health care can bridge the privacy
of people, like patients, and some breach about

the ethical concern. So basically, next 15 minutes,
I'm going to ask 15 to 20 questions. that have

to that in that you can give your opinion also
and what you think about that also other than

that the conversation between us will entire
recorded and also use as a study and research

only will not publish anywhere else or your
video and audio will not be tempered or not

misused any of either way so is this okay for
you Yes, it's okay. Yeah, then you shall we

start. Yeah So can you please describe? Uh about
what you do and can you tell us little bit

about yourself? Yes, my name is kennel and currently
I am pursuing my masters from technical university

of chemnitz in AI Okay Correct. So have you,
you are studying AI or you have you ever worked?

in AI project or not? Yes, I sometimes in small
projects I work with in machine learning. Okay,

so what do you think about the data that sometime
we give the data to the healthcare application

so they can work well. So sometime that our
healthcare application will not work. So some

of issue related data is that we give them correct
data or may that we are are not giving the

enough data so for of that kind of reason may
the healthcare application fail or something

like that so do you think that the data is important
for the training model or not yes i think the

data is very important for any training model
because of if we have some

camera cannot Perform very well Okay, so do
you think that the quality of data will affect

that okay we have to fit data That's all or
there is a importance of quality of data also

the correct situation of patients in particular
health care. Yeah, correct. So you have an

example like you work like that you get a very
less data or you get more data and then you

will not get able to get accurate result. You
have anything done with you before that? Yes,

I work... is called Parkinson. In that firstly
I have trained my AI model with small amount

of data which has a small number of parameters
so it can be not defined very much well. But

whenever I give them more data with more number
of parameters so AI model can identify the

disease very well. Yeah. Good luck. So now let's
talk about a patient's privacy and ethical

concern. So sometime what, what happened as
we already know that patients data got leaked

all over the internet, that personal data, like
a personal health issue also. So basically

what, what kind of things people can do, they
give a excess control measurement. For example,

all the data can access the doctor only the
moderate data. nurse or something like that.

So they can access the only a one department
data in which they are working or patients

can only access about their personal data. So
this kind of system are working. So are you

familiar with that? Like this kind of system
of working have you ever used or you heard

about that? Yes, I have heard about that, like
role-based access, like you said, the patient

can only read data about the personal details
and doctor can read all medical related data

about the patient. And there are some more authentication
methods like two-factor authentication or cyber

attacks. So do you think that this kind of role-based
access system will work? Yes, I think it will

work for

some systems. But after all there are some pitches
for this authentication. But we have to review

the whole... that factor and we can improve
idea. Okay. So from your perspective, what

are the ethical consideration at the most critical
while using AI in healthcare?

I for concerned confidentiality of the patient
data and privacy is most critical ethical consideration.

So do you think that AI impact patient's care
in treatment planning process in your experience?

Yes, I think in the basic planning for any small
disease, AI can help patient to the treatment

or pre-treatment for how can how can patient
take first aid for the disease So so do you

think that if AI give something to patients
So how the have you noticed that any changes

in patient's trust that how they are? The trust
is same when they are concerned doctor As same

as like with AI Yes, some patients have the
trust with AI as they have trust with doctor

but in some patients don't trust AI because
of the data bridge issue but if we educating

them them how AI is work and we can achieve
more trust from the profession. That could

be my next question that how we can get over
them. So yeah that's correct we can educate

them by organizing some workshop or something
like that so they can trust. Yeah. So yeah,

this comes us with the end of the interview
and so before we ending I would like to ask

that is anything Something that you would like
to share with us and I miss in asking question

so Okay, so yeah, thank you for joining and
your knowledge and again I would like to repeat

that this the video will be recorded and the
data will not be tempered and not not use anywhere

else. Thank you for joining. Thank you very
much.
